# Meme Me

This is the second portfolio app from Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree. With this app, the user can choose a picture from the photo album or take the picture using the camera and overlay texts in a meme style.

I'm currently updating some of the app's features.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/alvesmarcel/ios-nanodegree-meme-me.git
```
Then open MemeMe.xcodeproj in Xcode (7.0 or above) and build it.

**The Storyboard screen sizes should be configured to _w Compact h Any_.**
